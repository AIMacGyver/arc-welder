# Arc-Welder

Arc-Welder is a Python application that takes a natural language instruction or question and returns the appropriate response using the [Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/) API. The application uses an [Instructor model](https://instructor-embedding.github.io/) to map the user's question to a previous question, which is used to identify the appropriate GraphQL schema for use with [LangChain GraphQL tool](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/integrations/graphql).

This library is named after the Arc Welder gadget MacGyver created in Season 1 Episode 6 titled [Trumbo's World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638810/)

This repo builds on the ideas from Onuralp Soylemez's (@cx0) repo: https://github.com/cx0/chatGPT-for-genetics

Arc-Welder was developed with Python 3.11.0 and uses the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) Python project management tool. Please note that you need an OpenAI API Key to use Arc-Welder.

## Supported Instructions

Currently, Arc-Welder supports the following types of questions and instructions:

- "What are the targets of vorinostat?"
- "Find drugs that are used for treating ulcerative colitis"
- "Which diseases are associated with the genes targeted by fasudil?"

## Installation
